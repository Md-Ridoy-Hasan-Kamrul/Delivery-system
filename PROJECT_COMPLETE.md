## 💰 PRICING SYSTEM (Configured)

### Tier-Based Pricing

```
Tier A (Topps Newcastle):
  Base: £41.67 + VAT (20%) = £50.00 per 800kg

Tier B (All Other Stores):
  Base: £37.50 + VAT (20%) = £45.00 per 800kg
```

### Distance Surcharges

```
Base Distance: Up to 45 miles (included)
Additional Zones: +50% of base price per 45 miles
```

### Example Calculation

```
Delivery: 1600kg to 90 miles distance (Tier B)

Weight blocks: 1600 ÷ 800 = 2 blocks
Distance zones: 90 ÷ 45 = 2 zones

Base price: 2 × £37.50 = £75.00
Distance surcharge: £75.00 × 0.5 × 1 = £37.50
Subtotal: £112.50
VAT (20%): £22.50
Total: £135.00
